# TSF-GRIP-2021
**The Sparks Foundation Internship (Data Science &amp; Business Analytics Intern)**
TSF-Internship-Task
This is one of the tasks given to us in the internship we are doing with The Sparks Foundation i.e GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program )

Task 1 - To explore `Supervised Machine Learning`. In this regression task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. 
Problem statement: What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

Task 2 - To explore `Unsupervised Machine Learning` from the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we will predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

Task 3 - To explore and visualize `Decision Tree algorithm` for the given ‘Iris’ dataset. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
